# edge of my life

Last dollar just got spent.

First of month comes got to pay rent.

Where'd the money go?

Slipping through my hands.

I'm working with these hands.

Little Johnny need a lunch box.

Little Susy needs clothes & it won't stop.

Banks calling us up.

And they don't care 

It's more than I can bear

I gotta ,gotta believe

I can more than survive

Still one trick up my sleeve

We're gonna make this one shine

I gotta,gotta believe

I can more than survive

Still one trick up my sleeve

We're gonna make this one shine

a ,I'm at the edge of my life

i got no time to think twice

When I'm standing with the weight of the world on my shoulders

a, I'm gonna fight the good fight.

Cause I,I know I'll get by

When I battle every day through the pain like a soldier.

Mon crying on the sofa

Dad comes home but he's not sober

Where'd the family go

Up in smoke again

Feels just like sinking sand

Heard shouts in the backyard

Sirens ringing from a cop car

It's a rough day for this family man.

I'm praying with these hands

 I gotta ,gotta believe

I can more than survive

Still one trick up my sleeve

We're gonna make this one shine

I gotta,gotta believe

I can more than survive

Still one trick up my sleeve

We're gonna make this one shine

just don't look down,And you'll never fall.
